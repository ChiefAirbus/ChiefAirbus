## Hello Viewer

**ChiefAirbus is my official name**

I'm currently working on learning JavaScript utilizing GitHub and specific courses. I am starting out with Discord bots and progressing through the system. I'm currently a student in North Carolina who has obtained a Baisc Welding Certificate and working on my Associate in Arts. My side hustle is coding which I enjoy very much.
